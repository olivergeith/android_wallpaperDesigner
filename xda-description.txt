[B][SIZE="4"]What is this ?[/SIZE][/B]
This is a Live Wallpaper, that shows the current Battery Level in a "different" fancy way! It is customizable with different styles.
But it is not too fancy. I want it to match the current plain, simple and clean look of Android 4.4.

[B][SIZE="4"]Why this ?[/SIZE][/B]
Some of you may know me from my other thread [URL="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1918500"]"The Rom Fumbler"[/URL]. That is a tool to render and create Battery icons.
Now with Android 4.4 battery icons are drawn on the fly by some Java Class inside your ROM. 
The good old 204 png's are gone. And it is much more complicated to modify your Battery icon.
Even more: Now we have "Immersive Mode", Pie and so on, making the statusbar invisible.

[B]So I had some reasons to develope this app:[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]My Rom Fumbler is a little bit useless at the moment!
[*]I want to have a good look at my Battery level all the time!
[*]I dont want to waste real estate of my screen with a battery widget!
[*]I wanted to dive more into android app developement!
[*]I wanted to have my Rom Fumbler icon-styles back!
[*]Good thing ...now I have much more space to draw my Icons!

Read for getting the custom Background images
Write for debug purposes...(if you switch on the debugging option) the generated Battery-Images are written to /sdcard/Pictures/<stylename>/*.png
