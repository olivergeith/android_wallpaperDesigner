<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Howto:
Designs</h1>
<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">First
of all&#8230; what is a Design?</h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you play with
all the settings inside the Wallpaper Designer, you will finally come
to a state, where you finetuned all those parameters, and your rendered
wallpaper looks exactly how you want it to be&#8230;. Time to travel on and
try some other settings...wait&#8230;.what a pitty, that you loose all your
finetuned settings then!!! Oh wait again &#8230; no, you can store those
settings into a &#8222;Design&#8220; and
recall them later, whenever you want!!</p>
<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So
how do you save/store a Design?</h3><p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">That
is easy...on
the main-screen of the wallpaper Designer...tick the Menu-Button...(the
3 dots in the top-right corner) Select &#8222;Save current design&#8220;...thats
all!</p><p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><img style="width: 338px; height: 600px;" alt="save design" src="design-save.jpg"></p>
<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">And
how do I recall one of my stored Designs?</h3><p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">That
is easy too&#8230;
on the main-screen of the Wallpaper Designer...swipe in from the
left...or press the 3 white bars in the topleft corner of the App...a
drawer with all your beatifull designs will open...just tick one of
them&#8230;.and the App will load it up...super easy, right?</p><p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><img style="width: 338px; height: 601px;" alt="recall design" src="design-load.jpg"></p>
<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What
if I the list of saved Designs grows to a length, where it is not
usable any more?</h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Well
you can delete a single Design, or all of your desings...go into
&#8222;Settings
&#8594; Desings&#8220; and find the corresponding Menu-Entry!</p>
<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Hm...when
I delete all desings...they are all gone forever, right?</h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Yes
and no&#8230; you can
make a backup of them first&#8230; you have lots of options for this...you
will find these options in the same Settings &#8594; Desings Menu!</p><p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><img style="width: 338px; height: 601px;" alt="backup restore" src="design-backup-restore.jpg"></p>
<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I'm a
noob and dont know where to start will all those settings&#8230;</h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Well,
then you
should go and try out some Designs from the Internet&#8230; Go into &#8222;Settings
&#8594; Designs&#8220; ...right on top of this Menu you will find 4 options do
download Designs...the downloaded Designs will be stored within your
own local designs and can be recalled like explained above!</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These
Designs might be a good start to do your own derived Designs&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now
that I have my own Design, can I share it with friends and others ?</h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Yes...there
are
different options, and the easiest would be sharing it with our
users-community&#8230;.go into &#8222;Settings &#8594; Designs&#8220; again, and choose &#8222;Share
Design&#8220;&#8230; it will be uploaded to the &#8222;Community Designs&#8220; Everybody can
download it from there like explained above!</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">No
registration
needet, no boring options&#8230;.just choose the Design, you want to share
and thats it...super easy! (The downside&#8230;.there is no credit for the
creator of the uploaded Designs &#8230; Pure Anarchie&#8220; ;-)</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Attention
: I will
monitor this section and from time to time I will delete in within the
community designs&#8230; so dont use this as &#8222;Backup&#8220; for your Designs ;-)</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">And if
I see something very outstanding, I will copy this into the &#8222;Featured
Designs&#8220;!</p><p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><img style="width: 338px; height: 601px;" alt="share" src="design-share-download.jpg"></p>
